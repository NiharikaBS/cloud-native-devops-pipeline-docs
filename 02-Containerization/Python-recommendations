PYTHON MICROSERVICE CONTAINERIZATION

Description:
This process explains how to containerize a Python-based microservice using Docker
and enable OpenTelemetry support.

STEPS:

1. BASE IMAGE
   - Uses: python:3.12-slim-bookworm
   - A minimal, secure Python base image to reduce final container size.

2. SET WORKING DIRECTORY
   - /usr/src/app
   - All files will be copied and executed from here.

3. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   - Copy requirements.txt
   - Run:
     pip install --upgrade pip
     pip install -r requirements.txt

4. COPY SOURCE CODE
   - Copy all remaining files into the working directory.

5. ENABLE OPEN TELEMETRY
   - Run:
     opentelemetry-bootstrap -a install

6. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
   - RECOMMENDATION_PORT=1010

7. START THE SERVICE
   - Entrypoint:
     python recommendation_server.py

NOTES:
- This image supports distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry.
- Keeps the container lightweight and production-ready.
