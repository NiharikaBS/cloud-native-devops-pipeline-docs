Notes on AWS Route 53 for Domain Setup
==============================

What is Route 53?
-----------------
Amazon Route 53 is AWS’s scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is used to:
- Register new domains
- Manage DNS records
- Route end-user requests to infrastructure within and outside of AWS

Key Concepts
------------
- Hosted Zone: A container for records related to a domain. When you create a hosted zone, Route 53 automatically creates Name Server (NS) and Start of Authority (SOA) records.
- Alias Record: A special Route 53 record that maps your domain directly to AWS resources like Load Balancers without needing static IPs.
- DNS Propagation: The time it takes for DNS changes (like updated name servers) to spread across the internet. It typically takes up to 48 hours but is often faster.

Why Use Route 53 Instead of External DNS (e.g., GoDaddy)?
---------------------------------------------------------
Feature                            | Route 53        | External Providers
---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------
Alias Records for AWS Services    | Yes             | No
Auto IP Updates with AWS Load Balancer | Yes        | No (static only)
Full AWS Integration             | Yes             | Limited
Supports Root Domain + Subdomains | Yes             | CNAME only for subdomains

Step-by-Step: Connecting Domain via Route 53
--------------------------------------------
1. Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53  
   - Go to AWS Route 53 → Hosted Zones → "Create Hosted Zone"  
   - Enter your domain (e.g., myproject.shop)  
   - Select Public Hosted Zone  

2. Create DNS Record  
   - Inside the Hosted Zone → "Create Record"  
   - Use type A – IPv4 address (Alias)  
   - Choose "Alias to Application Load Balancer"  
   - Select your region and ALB  
   - Use name www.myproject.shop or root domain if supported  

3. Update Domain Name Servers in Your Registrar (e.g., GoDaddy)  
   - Copy the NS (Name Server) values from Route 53  
   - Go to your domain registrar account  
   - Replace the default name servers with those from Route 53  
   - Save and confirm changes  

Verifying DNS Setup
-------------------
- Use tools like:  
  - https://www.whatsmydns.net/  
  - nslookup yourdomain.com in the terminal  
- You should see the domain resolving to your AWS Load Balancer IP or DNS  

Best Practices
--------------
- Use Route 53 if your backend is hosted on AWS for tight integration and reliability  
- Avoid using GoDaddy DNS to point directly to ALB DNS name — does not support dynamic IPs and can lead to failures  
- Always use Alias Records for AWS services instead of CNAME or A records where possible  

Common Troubleshooting Tips
---------------------------
- DNS not resolving? Check:  
  - You saved the name server changes in your registrar  
  - DNS propagation time (wait 2–48 hours)  
  - Ingress hostname matches domain (e.g., www.myproject.shop)  
- Use curl --resolve to test:  
  curl --resolve www.myproject.shop:80:<ALB_IP> http://www.myproject.shop
